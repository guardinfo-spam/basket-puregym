# basket-puregym

the code was developed in a TDD manner, first adding a failing test and then writing just enough code to make sure the test passes.
I allowed myself 2 hours for this task, started at 10:00 am, finished at 12:15. 

This 2 hour window included:

- setting up the repo, project, doing the first commit
- thinking how i would implement this basket system, the time being quite short it won't be amazing, but it does the job
and provides support for what is needed.

I did not have time to implement the console app and as such there won't be any messages showing what vouchrs were applied etc
the idea was to set a simple boolean flag when a voucher would be applied so then the client can simply go and look at that
and display the appropriate message.

The way the basket value is calculated is very naive, but it does ther job for a first iteration.
All in all, this was a fun little project which required the old brain cells to actually do a bit of thinking
Thank you
